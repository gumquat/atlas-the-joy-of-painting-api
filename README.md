## In the provided UML Class Diagram:

* The TVEpisode class has a one-to-many relationship with ColorPalette, which represents the colors used in the episode.
* The TVEpisode class also has a many-to-many relationship with SubjectMatter, which represents the topics or subject matter covered in the episode.
* The FilterCriteria class has attributes to hold filtering criteria for genre, air date range, series name, colors list, and topic list.

## With this design, you can filter TV episodes based on:

* Colors Used: By specifying a list of colors in the FilterCriteria class, you can filter episodes that have those colors in their ColorPalette.
* Subject Matter: By specifying a list of topics in the FilterCriteria class, you can filter episodes that cover those topics in their SubjectMatter.
* Episode Dates: By specifying an air date range in the FilterCriteria class, you can filter episodes that fall within that date range.

This design allows for flexible filtering based on the specified requirements and can be extended further if additional filtering criteria are needed in the future.
